# Chatbot Connection Error Fix

## Issue
The chatbot was showing "Connection error. Attempting to reconnect..." and was unable to establish WebSocket connections.

## Root Cause
The Django backend server was running in WSGI mode using `python manage.py runserver`, which doesn't support WebSocket connections. WebSocket support requires ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface).

## Solution Applied

### 1. Identified the Problem
- WebSocket requests were returning 404 errors
- Server logs showed "Not Found: /ws/chat/" errors
- The server was running in WSGI mode instead of ASGI mode

### 2. Fixed Server Configuration
- Stopped the WSGI server (`python manage.py runserver`)
- Started ASGI server using Daphne: `python -m daphne -p 8000 mediswift_backend.asgi:application`
- Verified all required packages (channels, daphne, channels-redis) were installed

### 3. Verified WebSocket Configuration
- ✅ ASGI configuration in `backend/mediswift_backend/asgi.py` is correct
- ✅ WebSocket routing in `backend/chat/routing.py` is properly configured
- ✅ Chat consumer in `backend/chat/consumers.py` handles connections correctly
- ✅ Frontend WebSocket service in `src/lib/chat.service.ts` is properly implemented

## Current Status

### ✅ **Backend Server**
- Running with ASGI support on port 8000
- WebSocket endpoint `/ws/chat/` is accessible
- HTTP API endpoints still working correctly
- Authentication working for both HTTP and WebSocket

### ✅ **WebSocket Connection**
- Successfully establishes connection
- Receives welcome message
- Processes user messages
- Returns AI responses with medicine information
- Handles authentication via JWT tokens

### ✅ **Chat Functionality**
- Real-time messaging working
- AI assistant responds to health queries
- Medicine recommendations provided
- Connection status indicators working
- Reconnection logic functional

## Testing Results

### WebSocket Test Results:
```
✅ Authentication successful
✅ WebSocket connection established  
✅ Welcome message received
✅ Test message sent successfully
✅ Bot response received
```

### HTTP API Test Results:
```
✅ Profile API working
✅ Authentication endpoints working
✅ All REST endpoints functional
```

## Files Involved

### Backend Configuration:
- `backend/mediswift_backend/asgi.py` - ASGI application setup
- `backend/chat/routing.py` - WebSocket URL routing
- `backend/chat/consumers.py` - WebSocket message handling
- `backend/requirements.txt` - Required packages (channels, daphne)

### Frontend Implementation:
- `src/lib/chat.service.ts` - WebSocket client service
- `src/components/chat/ChatWidget.tsx` - Chat UI component

## Server Commands

### To Start Backend with WebSocket Support:
```bash
cd backend
python -m daphne -p 8000 mediswift_backend.asgi:application
```

### To Start Frontend:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Key Features Working

1. **Real-time Chat**: Instant messaging between user and AI
2. **Medicine Recommendations**: AI provides medicine suggestions for symptoms
3. **Authentication**: Secure WebSocket connections with JWT tokens
4. **Connection Management**: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
5. **Error Handling**: Proper error messages and retry mechanisms
6. **Status Indicators**: Visual connection status in chat widget

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Chatbot is now fully functional
2. ✅ WebSocket connections working properly
3. ✅ All error messages resolved
4. ✅ Real-time messaging operational

The chatbot connection error has been completely resolved. Users can now:
- Open the chat widget
- Send messages to the AI assistant
- Receive real-time responses about medicines and health queries
- Experience seamless connection management with automatic reconnection if needed

## Production Deployment Note

For production deployment, consider using:
- **Gunicorn + Uvicorn** for ASGI support
- **Redis** for channel layers (already configured)
- **WebSocket load balancing** for multiple server instances
- **SSL/TLS** for secure WebSocket connections (wss://)
