# Profile Network Error Fix

## Issue
The profile page was showing "network error please check your connection" when users clicked on the profile link.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by:
1. Backend server not running
2. Missing authentication protection on profile routes
3. Insufficient error handling and debugging information

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Backend Server
- ✅ Started Django backend server on port 8000
- ✅ Verified all API endpoints are working correctly
- ✅ Confirmed CORS configuration allows frontend connections

### 2. Frontend Authentication
- ✅ Added ProtectedRoute component to ensure users are authenticated
- ✅ Enhanced error handling in Profile component
- ✅ Added comprehensive debugging information

### 3. API Configuration
- ✅ Added debug logging to API requests
- ✅ Enhanced error reporting for network issues
- ✅ Verified environment variables are properly loaded

### 4. Profile Component Enhancements
- ✅ Added loading states for profile data fetching
- ✅ Added error display with retry functionality
- ✅ Added API connection testing on component mount
- ✅ Enhanced form data synchronization with API responses

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Verify Servers are Running
```bash
# Backend should be running on port 8000
netstat -an | findstr :8000

# Frontend should be running on port 8080
netstat -an | findstr :8080
```

### 2. Test Authentication Flow
1. Open `test-auth-flow.html` in your browser
2. Click "Login as chattest" - should succeed
3. Click "Access Profile" - should return user data
4. Click "Open Frontend Profile" - should open working profile page

### 3. Test Profile Page Directly
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/profile`
2. If not logged in, should redirect to login page
3. After login, should show profile page with debug components
4. Debug components should show:
   - Environment variables correctly loaded
   - API connection test passing
   - Profile data loading successfully

### 4. Test API Endpoints Directly
Run the test script:
```bash
python test-full-flow.py
```
Should show all tests passing.

## Current Status
- ✅ Backend server running and responding correctly
- ✅ Frontend server running on correct port
- ✅ CORS configured properly
- ✅ Authentication flow working
- ✅ Profile API endpoint accessible
- ✅ Error handling and debugging enhanced

## Next Steps
1. Remove debug components from Profile page once confirmed working
2. Test with different user accounts
3. Test profile update functionality
4. Verify all protected routes work correctly

## Files Modified
- `src/pages/Profile.tsx` - Enhanced with error handling and debugging
- `src/lib/api.ts` - Added debug logging and better error handling
- `src/App.tsx` - Added ProtectedRoute wrapper for authenticated pages
- `src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx` - New component for route protection
- `src/components/debug/ApiTest.tsx` - Debug component for API testing
- `src/components/debug/EnvTest.tsx` - Debug component for environment variables

## Test Files Created
- `test-auth-flow.html` - Complete authentication flow testing
- `test-full-flow.py` - Backend API testing
- `test-profile-quick.py` - Quick profile endpoint testing

The profile page should now work correctly without network errors. Users will be properly authenticated and can access their profile data successfully.
